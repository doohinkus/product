# _Epicodus Product Page_

#### _A web page that advertises fruit, 11/18/2016_

#### By _**Rafael Perez**_

## Description

_A colorful page dedicated to nutritious fruit._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone repository._
* _Double click "index.html"_
* _Or view the [Fruit Project](https://doohinkus.github.io/product/) now._


_If "index.html" fails to open when double clicked, then drag the file into your favorite browser._

## Known Bugs

_The links at the top of the menu do not work BECAUSE I'm working a pure CSS smooth scrolling feature. I am unsure about the best way to use the link IDs, therefore I left them black. Clicking on any link brings you back to the top of the page, not the content area._

## Support and contact details

_If you have any issue with this code, please contact me._

## Technologies Used

_HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. All effects are achieved with CSS, no javascript whatsoever!_
